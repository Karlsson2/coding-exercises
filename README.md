#1 The 100-50-20 ATM

I continously want to remove 100 until we reach the breakingpoint of 100 for numbers that we can turn into purely 100's. OR 110 and 130 which can't be turned into 50s and 20s respectively. 
Then there is another similar check for the 50's where the number 80 and 60 cant be turned into a 50 and a number of 20's but can be turned into a multiple of 20s instead.
